When the new board is designed it should include a battery sensor b/c we'll want to notify the user to change the battery before the power goes out and erases everything.
Also, we should design the RTC so that any 2032 sized battery can be used.
Measure power use, see if the Pi can throttle down clock tics, and publish stats.
Turn on the hardware watchdog (I think the Pi has one, need to check).
Figure out bug with the ATC sometimes failing to save data.
We have to put "Powered by the Raspberry Pi" somewhere on the outside.
The ease (possibility) of getting enough boards (may need to contact OEM or CM for the Pi directly).
Write basic mod instructions (how to save, setup from bare OS, card image, why read-only, MMC can do whatever it wants).
The synchronization with the state variable bg thread is slightly broken in that a reader can get an inconsistent state if the variables are read between setting the event and the var lock aquisition in the background thread.  This is not so important if there is only ever one person using the web pages at a time, but should be fixed nonetheless.
There is a lot of retipition in HTMLContent, sorry.  I didn't spend more abstracting it out b/c I suspect we are going to change all of it anyway.
