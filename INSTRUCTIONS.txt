LED states:

    * OFF means no power or booting.
    * SOLIDLY ON means that the box is not been set up (no enabled alarms).
    * BLINKING FAST (4 times/sec) means the box is unlocked can can be opened.
    * BREATHING means it is locked.
    * BLINKING SLOW (once every five secs) means something is wrong.

After plugging in the box wait for the LED to illuminate and then connect your
laptop to the wifi network created by the box with network name:

    Go to http://box.box/ (172.16.0.1).

(Yes that whole thing is the network name and should be visible in the drop-
down wifi menu.)  You should be able to go to any http site (but https won't
work) and get the box page.
